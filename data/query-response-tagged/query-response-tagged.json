Me giving out sandwiches to the poor.\u201d \n\nI thought this was incredibly vain so I commented \u201cIt was nice of you to do this but I\u2019ve never been able to understand why people feel the need to video tape and post themselves doing something nice. Doesn\u2019t this kind of defeat the entire purpose of doing a good deed? it becomes clear that your motivation isn\u2019t exclusively that you want to help others?\u201d\n\nI received a good amount of hate for this comment so I\u2019m wondering reddit - AM I THE ASSHOLE??

      "text": "My wife (married 6 years, together 10 years) is a stay-at-home parent for our two children (4, 1.5). \nI work pretty long hours and sometimes travel for work, leaving her to do most the parenting and housework. On weekends I generally pitch in, spending time with the kids, cooking, etc. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019ve decided to go on a long weekend with a friend to a music festival, Thursday to Sunday. \nIt\u2019s been hard on my wife, she\u2019s exhausted from the week and then she\u2019s not getting a break over the weekend as I\u2019ve gone away. \n\nI feel bad for leaving her and it\u2019s tough on her, but it\u2019s one weekend away in the year. \n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that 4 days away is too much and that I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit - AITA?"

She doesn't want to do that though and immediately gets annoyed by me not wanting to take her and thinks I'm embarrassed to introduce them together. They've met multiple times and there is no problem there.\n\nUsually though the cinema is a chance to have a chat with one of my oldest friends about life and problems and it's easier for both of us to do that if she is not there. She doesn't seem to understand that though even after explanation. "

Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests."

      "text": "I grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother.   It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  "

I agree to play with him and I tell him I\u2019m decent but I\u2019m not the greatest. We start playing and he tells me we don\u2019t have a healer so he tells me to be the healer. Support is what I\u2019m best at and what he\u2019s worst at but I don\u2019t like playing support so I pick some ninja guy who I thought looked cool. He gets really annoyed and says that our team is going to lose as nobody else is picking support. He caves in and plays as a support class and does really bad with it. He tells me to switch to support because I\u2019m doing bad with my character, he\u2019s doing bad as our support and our team is losing. I don\u2019t have fun playing as support so I just keep trying out different characters.  My girlfriend is also with me so I let her play while I go bathroom. She\u2019s even worse than I am and by the time I get back my team has already lost the game. He\u2019s pretty mad and I think he\u2019s rank went down or something. In my opinion the point of games is to have fun and I don\u2019t have fun when people are telling me how I should playing. It\u2019s just a game and I think he took the whole thing too seriously "

We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it."

They were both very nice and offered emotional support which was much appreciated. Later during the day, one of the two, who is a very religious Jewish man, texted me the following:\n\nHim: \"hey, can you tell me {my famaly member's} full name so i can pray for him?\"\n\nMe: \"please don't :)\"\n\nMe: \"but i appreciate the sentiment\"\n\nHim \"you're welcome\"\n\nTo give context, I'm an atheist, and i am very much against these kinds of things (and so is the mentioned family member tbh) . He knows it about me, and we are very respectful to each other's beliefs or lack thereof. We didn't talk about it anymore but had some small talk after it and it doesn't seem to have bothered him, but i can't really know for sure.\n\nWas i the asshole? Could i have maybe handled it better? "

      "text": "My mom is retired and watches my daughter (18 months) for me while I\u2019m at work. I do appreciate it a lot and she never wants money. The thing is, I don\u2019t always feel like she fully takes me seriously as a parent. I\u2019m single and I struggled a bit in the beginning and I\u2019m not sure my mom ever fully let that go. \n\nHere\u2019s what happened this time. I tried very hard to wean my daughter off of the bottle when she was a year old and communicated with my mother a lot about the switch to sippy cups. \n\nI came home early the other day because of a huge power outage at my job. I see my daughter on the couch happily sucking her bottle. I confronted my mother about it who said she only gives it to her \u201cwhen she gets hysterical\u201d. I flipped out and I did raise my voice. \n\nWhat\u2019s super annoying is that I know my daughter is smart enough to know what\u2019s going on too since she never even cries to me for one. So basically it\u2019s been their little secret. \n\nAnyway my mom is now mad at me and barely speaking to me. But I feel like anyone would have been angry in my position? AITA for how I reacted?"

      "text": "So first things first, I work with the mentally disabled and this one client loves to play dress up and his favorite one is wearing full ACU's.  I served in the military and I just don't like it when others wear the uniform without serving. He likes to play the \"I'm an honorary member of my brothers unit\" which he is, but it's no reason to wear the uniform(imo).  I told him that I don't care what he wears while I am not working with him, but when I am to not wear it.  It also gets VERY uncomfortable in public because when someone walks up to him and asks \"your in the military?\" He will lie and say that he is and starts trying to explain what he does and I have to intervene and explain the situation.  I know I am probably the asshole and I should just let him, hes not hurting anyone, but it just annoys me when he goes out and tries to lie about something he never did."

(that has a little higher-class ring to it.) meeting someone in a bar sounds rather cheap, but some nice people go to bars alone and don't mind if someone strikes up a conversation with them.\ni avoid eye contact with people i pass in a park, especially if they're walking slowly, or like they're just killing time.\ni think you get the idea. what's ok and what isn't? friendly, but confused"

(or, more accurately, lack of money.) i never felt the love a child should feel from his family.\nmy problem these days is my alcohol intake. i can't stay away from beer. i drink to forget my family problems and the fact that i can't seem to get anything right.\ni dropped out of college because i don't have a passion for anything or anyone. i used to have hobbies -- like writing, photography, etc. -- but the beer has taken away my motivation and creativity.\ni feel i'm losing my will to keep trying. i want so badly to keep trying, but my emotions are keeping me down. i just want something new, something i can give my all to, something that won't hurt me in the future. -- what can i do?"

We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? "

However, on the topic of having children it's always contentious.\n\nWe've talked about marriage and she always brings up how she wants children. I'm not so excited about it but if I did, I would rather adopt if we did have kids, but to be honest I'd rather have none at all. \n\nFor me, I don't want to give them any of the genes I have that gave me horrible anxiety since I was really young that really interfered with my daily life. Plus, I think the world is regressing with irreversible climate change and as resources and geographies change in the next 40-50 years, I can't say the quality of life would be something I would be looking forward to.\n\nGF will not budge. She wants \"her own\" kids and to me that's really selfish. I understand why - since it's your biologic compulsion to reproduce - but logic can override impulse and I'd rather have none at all or adopt.\n\nIt's driving a serious wedge, but I honestly think I'm in the right."

He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn't require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn't realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn't try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I'm tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I'm not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I'm also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything."

My wife likes the vegetarian food but wants me to cook some non vegetarian food for her aswell sometimes. For example when I cook meat free sausages she wants me to cook normal sausages for her aswell. This would be fine but I already don't like cooking and this just makes it more complicated and time consuming. Also if she wants meat she could just eat it when I'm not cooking or do more cooking herself. AITA for wanting her to eat my vegetarian food?"

I mentioned that my boyfriend and I don\u2019t have it often and that he doesn\u2019t give oral because he doesn\u2019t like it. I didn\u2019t bash him for either, I had just mentioned it. One of the girls I was talking to told my boyfriend yesterday that she feels bad for me since we don\u2019t have sex very often and my boyfriend got pissed that I talk about intimate things with them and said it\u2019s none of their business and is now wondering what kind of things I tell my closer friends. The thing is, I do tell my close friends about my relationship including my sex life and even sometimes telling them about a fight we got in or something. Also, I have been there when he has said something about our sex life to one of his friends, but maybe I just do it to a more intimate degree or more often. He\u2019s now pissed and says he can\u2019t trust me anymore and is telling me that if it\u2019s that big of deal then I should find someone else. I always thought this kind of conversation with friends was normal and healthy considering I\u2019m not degrading him or telling his \u201csecrets\u201d or something to them. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. AITA for discussing my relationship/sex life with my friends?"

He's a geologist for a major oil company and works very, very hard and makes a good living. But we have had to live in some real shit holes over the years (like SA, where I really didn't leave our company compound for 2 years). We are back in the LA area and he thinks now we have \"open roads\" (the 405...what?) he wants a motorcycle. \n\nI am dead against it. They are too dangerous, it probably won't get used, it's a bad example for the kids, it looks super douche-bro, and I think he'll move onto his next hobby and forget about it.\n\nWe aren't getting divorced over this or anything but our opposing stances are causing major friction.

We decided that we are going to use the money to see the world and live in exotic places while trying to get our dream careers going (me: writer, she: clothing designer). We also wanted to live in underserved communities where we could be around real people instead of the Dallas suburbs we grew up in or in gentrified SoHo where we moved from.\n\n\nWe decided on South Tucson, AZ. It is 90% Hispanic, historic and gorgeous. We were able to buy a house for a song and we eagerly moved in 2 weeks ago. However the reception has not been good. At first we figured that maybe we were the first open lesbian couple they had seen so we went around and introduced ourself last week and people were either not friendly and our 65 year old neighbor told us that white people like us only bring problems to the neighborhood. We asked her to explain, she said if she has to explain then we truly don\u2019t get it. \n\nI don\u2019t think we are assholes but I sure felt like it  after speaking with our neighbor. We are just trying to experience a different culture...I thought that was a good thing.\n"

I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?"

I said there\u2019s plenty of people who split up, a parent dies etc and the kid is fine. She said but having a mother and father is still better...I said not necessarily. If those parents were abusive, poor and couldn\u2019t care properly for their kids then they\u2019re not gonna be better than two parents of the same sex who aren\u2019t abusive and can financially and emotionally support their kids. She then said that money had nothing to do with it and a poor heterosexual would be much better parents than a financially stable gay couple \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI said that\u2019s bullshit. I said us not having a lot of money growing up did badly affect me. It made everything a lot harder, my mental and physical health suffered because of it. I also said that my parents constant arguing and fighting with one another, plus my mothers constant screaming at me affected me badly and it would have been better for me to be bought up by gay people who could finically support me and who didn\u2019t give me severe anxiety from the constant fighting. \n\nShe\u2019s now not talking to me. Calling me disrespectful, saying she gave up a lot for me and I\u2019m ungrateful. \n\nSo AITA for saying this, or is she the asshole? "

I do help with the newborn when I am home and for anything my wife or baby needs till I go to sleep. \n\nI want to be able to sleep through the night since I\u2019m up late and have to work in the morning but my wife expects me to wake up every 2-3 hours and help with feedings and stuff while she pumps to try to get met milk in. \n\nAMTA for not wanting to wake up and help?"

(there is alcoholism in my family, so my heart went out to her.) she said she was 69, but she looked much older. she started shaking badly, and began looking for her bottle. (she had bottles hidden all over the place, but the ones i found were empty!) we visited for half an hour, then she fell asleep on the couch, so i called the apartment manager who turned out to be a young lady about 35. she said, \"leave her alone; don't get involved. go on home.\"\ni went home, but, abby, this poor lady has called me five times asking me to come back. part of me says, \"go back and try to help her,\" and the other half says, \"listen to the manager--don't get involved.\"\ni feel guilty because like most people, i don't want to get involved, but i can't get this lady out of my mind. she said she has no family. what would you do in a case like this? w.f., palmyra, neb."
