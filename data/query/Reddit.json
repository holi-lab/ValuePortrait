One of the girls I was talking to told my boyfriend yesterday that she feels bad for me since we don‚Äôt have sex very often and my boyfriend got pissed that I talk about intimate things with them and said it‚Äôs none of their business and is now wondering what kind of things I tell my closer friends. The thing is, I do tell my close friends about my relationship including my sex life and even sometimes telling them about a fight we got in or something. Also, I have been there when he has said something about our sex life to one of his friends, but maybe I just do it to a more intimate degree or more often. He‚Äôs now pissed and says he can‚Äôt trust me anymore and is telling me that if it‚Äôs that big of deal then I should find someone else. I always thought this kind of conversation with friends was normal and healthy considering I‚Äôm not degrading him or telling his ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù or something to them. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. AITA for discussing my relationship/sex life with my friends?"

I told him that I don't care what he wears while I am not working with him, but when I am to not wear it.  It also gets VERY uncomfortable in public because when someone walks up to him and asks \"your in the military?\" He will lie and say that he is and starts trying to explain what he does and I have to intervene and explain the situation.  I know I am probably the asshole and I should just let him, hes not hurting anyone, but it just annoys me when he goes out and tries to lie about something he never did."

I'm not so excited about it but if I did, I would rather adopt if we did have kids, but to be honest I'd rather have none at all. \n\nFor me, I don't want to give them any of the genes I have that gave me horrible anxiety since I was really young that really interfered with my daily life. Plus, I think the world is regressing with irreversible climate change and as resources and geographies change in the next 40-50 years, I can't say the quality of life would be something I would be looking forward to.\n\nGF will not budge. She wants \"her own\" kids and to me that's really selfish. I understand why - since it's your biologic compulsion to reproduce - but logic can override impulse and I'd rather have none at all or adopt.\n\nIt's driving a serious wedge, but I honestly think I'm in the right."

We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it."

We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?"

They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they‚Äôre fine with what they have. We also don‚Äôt allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don‚Äôt allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we‚Äôve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I‚Äôm being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? "

I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn‚Äôt drink that often anyways so it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that‚Äôs exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she‚Äôs come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I‚Äôve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I‚Äôm projecting my mother‚Äôs problem on our situation.

She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she‚Äôs outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we‚Äôre both adults.

She doesn't want to do that though and immediately gets annoyed by me not wanting to take her and thinks I'm embarrassed to introduce them together. They've met multiple times and there is no problem there.\n\nUsually though the cinema is a chance to have a chat with one of my oldest friends about life and problems and it's easier for both of us to do that if she is not there. She doesn't seem to understand that though even after explanation. "

She wears stupid shoes and walks too slow, but gets tired of places too fast.\n\nI did originally have a meeting in London but it got cancelled and I still wanted to go, so I booked myself into a fancy hotel, went to galleries, rode the subway and ate in amazing restaurants for three nights. Aw man it was awesome. I just enjoyed not caring about her being entertained and being alone to my thoughts.\n\nI just kept thinking the whole time I was there how she wouldn't have liked it, and would have ruined it. If I'd have told her about it she would have come with me, no question. \n\nAm I an asshole?"

We decided that we are going to use the money to see the world and live in exotic places while trying to get our dream careers going (me: writer, she: clothing designer). We also wanted to live in underserved communities where we could be around real people instead of the Dallas suburbs we grew up in or in gentrified SoHo where we moved from.\n\n\nWe decided on South Tucson, AZ. It is 90% Hispanic, historic and gorgeous. We were able to buy a house for a song and we eagerly moved in 2 weeks ago. However the reception has not been good. At first we figured that maybe we were the first open lesbian couple they had seen so we went around and introduced ourself last week and people were either not friendly and our 65 year old neighbor told us that white people like us only bring problems to the neighborhood. We asked her to explain, she said if she has to explain then we truly don‚Äôt get it. \n\nI don‚Äôt think we are assholes but I sure felt like it  after speaking with our neighbor. We are just trying to experience a different culture...I thought that was a good thing.\n"

One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests."
