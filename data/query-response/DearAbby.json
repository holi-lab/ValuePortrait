(she never did that before she was on drugs.)\nwe are students, and i can't study because i'm so worried about her.\ntwo weeks ago i decided i couldn't stand it any more and made a decision to stay away from her. i still would like to be jennifer's friend because i remember what a sweet girl she used to be. but now i don't know if i even like her. even though i feel freedom after separating from her, i worry that maybe i'm making her life worse by not being there for her when she needs me.\nabby, should i still be a friend of hers or not? -- confused in california"
