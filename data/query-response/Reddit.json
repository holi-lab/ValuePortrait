I mentioned that my boyfriend and I don’t have it often and that he doesn’t give oral because he doesn’t like it. I didn’t bash him for either, I had just mentioned it. One of the girls I was talking to told my boyfriend yesterday that she feels bad for me since we don’t have sex very often and my boyfriend got pissed that I talk about intimate things with them and said it’s none of their business and is now wondering what kind of things I tell my closer friends. The thing is, I do tell my close friends about my relationship including my sex life and even sometimes telling them about a fight we got in or something. Also, I have been there when he has said something about our sex life to one of his friends, but maybe I just do it to a more intimate degree or more often. He’s now pissed and says he can’t trust me anymore and is telling me that if it’s that big of deal then I should find someone else. I always thought this kind of conversation with friends was normal and healthy considering I’m not degrading him or telling his “secrets” or something to them. Maybe I’m wrong. AITA for discussing my relationship/sex life with my friends?"

Son has started asking to play but we’ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I’m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds.

I just asked her that she doesn’t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn’t drink that often anyways so it wouldn’t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that’s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she’s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I’ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I’m projecting my mother’s problem on our situation.  That she’s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it’s not really about her being abusive, it’s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she’s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we’re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  "

      "text": "So today i had told 2 of my colleagues (who i regard as friends) that we discovered that my family member (a very very close one) has cancer, and that the situation is very bad. They were both very nice and offered emotional support which was much appreciated. Later during the day, one of the two, who is a very religious Jewish man, texted me the following:\n\nHim: \"hey, can you tell me {my famaly member's} full name so i can pray for him?\"\n\nMe: \"please don't :)\"\n\nMe: \"but i appreciate the sentiment\"\n\nHim \"you're welcome\"\n\nTo give context, I'm an atheist, and i am very much against these kinds of things (and so is the mentioned family member tbh) . He knows it about me, and we are very respectful to each other's beliefs or lack thereof. We didn't talk about it anymore but had some small talk after it and it doesn't seem to have bothered him, but i can't really know for sure.\n\nWas i the asshole? Could i have maybe handled it better? "

Support is what I’m best at and what he’s worst at but I don’t like playing support so I pick some ninja guy who I thought looked cool. He gets really annoyed and says that our team is going to lose as nobody else is picking support. He caves in and plays as a support class and does really bad with it. He tells me to switch to support because I’m doing bad with my character, he’s doing bad as our support and our team is losing. I don’t have fun playing as support so I just keep trying out different characters.  My girlfriend is also with me so I let her play while I go bathroom. She’s even worse than I am and by the time I get back my team has already lost the game. He’s pretty mad and I think he’s rank went down or something. In my opinion the point of games is to have fun and I don’t have fun when people are telling me how I should playing. It’s just a game and I think he took the whole thing too seriously "

I see my daughter on the couch happily sucking her bottle. I confronted my mother about it who said she only gives it to her “when she gets hysterical”.

Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests."
