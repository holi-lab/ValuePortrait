      "text": "7 years ago I impregnated my girlfriend at the time. I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it."

He knows it about me, and we are very respectful to each other's beliefs or lack thereof. We didn't talk about it anymore but had some small talk after it and it doesn't seem to have bothered him, but i can't really know for sure.\n\nWas i the asshole?

(or, more accurately, lack of money.) i never felt the love a child should feel from his family.\nmy problem these days is my alcohol intake. i can't stay away from beer. i drink to forget my family problems and the fact that i can't seem to get anything right.\ni dropped out of college because i don't have a passion for anything or anyone. i used to have hobbies -- like writing, photography, etc. -- but the beer has taken away my motivation and creativity.\ni feel i'm losing my will to keep trying. i want so badly to keep trying, but my emotions are keeping me down. i just want something new, something i can give my all to, something that won't hurt me in the future. -- what can i do?"
