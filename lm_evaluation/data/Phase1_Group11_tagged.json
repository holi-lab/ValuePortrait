The thing is, I do tell my close friends about my relationship including my sex life and even sometimes telling them about a fight we got in or something. Also, I have been there when he has said something about our sex life to one of his friends, but maybe I just do it to a more intimate degree or more often. He\u2019s now pissed and says he can\u2019t trust me anymore and is telling me that if it\u2019s that big of deal then I should find someone else. I always thought this kind of conversation with friends was normal and healthy considering I\u2019m not degrading him or telling his \u201csecrets\u201d or something to them. Maybe I\u2019m wrong.
