      "text": "I grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother.   It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  "

I agree to play with him and I tell him I\u2019m decent but I\u2019m not the greatest. We start playing and he tells me we don\u2019t have a healer so he tells me to be the healer. Support is what I\u2019m best at and what he\u2019s worst at but I don\u2019t like playing support so I pick some ninja guy who I thought looked cool. He gets really annoyed and says that our team is going to lose as nobody else is picking support. He caves in and plays as a support class and does really bad with it. He tells me to switch to support because I\u2019m doing bad with my character, he\u2019s doing bad as our support and our team is losing. I don\u2019t have fun playing as support so I just keep trying out different characters.  My girlfriend is also with me so I let her play while I go bathroom. She\u2019s even worse than I am and by the time I get back my team has already lost the game. He\u2019s pretty mad and I think he\u2019s rank went down or something. In my opinion the point of games is to have fun and I don\u2019t have fun when people are telling me how I should playing. It\u2019s just a game and I think he took the whole thing too seriously "
