I do help with the newborn when I am home and for anything my wife or baby needs till I go to sleep. \n\nI want to be able to sleep through the night since I\u2019m up late and have to work in the morning but my wife expects me to wake up every 2-3 hours and help with feedings and stuff while she pumps to try to get met milk in. \n\nAMTA for not wanting to wake up and help?"
