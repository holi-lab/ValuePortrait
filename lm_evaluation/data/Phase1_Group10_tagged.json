Recently though whenever there is a big block buster my girlfriend insists on coming along. I've said to her that I am happy to see a film again on the weekend as it gives me a chance to catch some parts I may have missed. She doesn't want to do that though and immediately gets annoyed by me not wanting to take her and thinks I'm embarrassed to introduce them together. They've met multiple times and there is no problem there.\n\nUsually though the cinema is a chance to have a chat with one of my oldest friends about life and problems and it's easier for both of us to do that if she is not there. She doesn't seem to understand that though even after explanation. "

One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole.
