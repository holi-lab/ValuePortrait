      "text": "I have two children a 7 year old son and a 9 year old girl. We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? "

I'm not so excited about it but if I did, I would rather adopt if we did have kids, but to be honest I'd rather have none at all. \n\nFor me, I don't want to give them any of the genes I have that gave me horrible anxiety since I was really young that really interfered with my daily life. Plus, I think the world is regressing with irreversible climate change and as resources and geographies change in the next 40-50 years, I can't say the quality of life would be something I would be looking forward to.\n\nGF will not budge. She wants \"her own\" kids and to me that's really selfish. I understand why - since it's your biologic compulsion to reproduce - but logic can override impulse and I'd rather have none at all or adopt.\n\nIt's driving a serious wedge, but I honestly think I'm in the right."
