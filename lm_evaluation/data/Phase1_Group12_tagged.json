He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn't require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn't realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn't try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I'm tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I'm not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I'm also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything."
