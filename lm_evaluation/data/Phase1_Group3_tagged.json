He's a geologist for a major oil company and works very, very hard and makes a good living. But we have had to live in some real shit holes over the years (like SA, where I really didn't leave our company compound for 2 years). We are back in the LA area and he thinks now we have \"open roads\" (the 405...what?) he wants a motorcycle. \n\nI am dead against it. They are too dangerous, it probably won't get used, it's a bad example for the kids, it looks super douche-bro, and I think he'll move onto his next hobby and forget about it.\n\nWe aren't getting divorced over this or anything but our opposing stances are causing major friction.
