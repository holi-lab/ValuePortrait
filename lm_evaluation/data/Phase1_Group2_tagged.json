You really sound like you don't want to. I can just do it if you're not up for it.\"\n\n\"No, I'll just do the stupid favor!\"\n\n\"Alright, well either don't do it, or stop whining about it!\"\n\nI feel like an asshole because I'm so harsh at a person who's willing to do something for me, but at the same time, they clearly don't want to do it, so why do it and complain when I repeatedly tell them that they don't have to?"

We decided that we are going to use the money to see the world and live in exotic places while trying to get our dream careers going (me: writer, she: clothing designer). We also wanted to live in underserved communities where we could be around real people instead of the Dallas suburbs we grew up in or in gentrified SoHo where we moved from.\n\n\nWe decided on South Tucson, AZ. It is 90% Hispanic, historic and gorgeous. We were able to buy a house for a song and we eagerly moved in 2 weeks ago. However the reception has not been good. At first we figured that maybe we were the first open lesbian couple they had seen so we went around and introduced ourself last week and people were either not friendly and our 65 year old neighbor told us that white people like us only bring problems to the neighborhood. We asked her to explain, she said if she has to explain then we truly don\u2019t get it. \n\nI don\u2019t think we are assholes but I sure felt like it  after speaking with our neighbor. We are just trying to experience a different culture...I thought that was a good thing.\n"
