      "text": "My boyfriend of over a year and I are going to an out of country destination for a week in March. I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times likes a mother and child dynamic.\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip?"

If those parents were abusive, poor and couldn\u2019t care properly for their kids then they\u2019re not gonna be better than two parents of the same sex who aren\u2019t abusive and can financially and emotionally support their kids. She then said that money had nothing to do with it and a poor heterosexual would be much better parents than a financially stable gay couple \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI said that\u2019s bullshit. I said us not having a lot of money growing up did badly affect me. It made everything a lot harder, my mental and physical health suffered because of it. I also said that my parents constant arguing and fighting with one another, plus my mothers constant screaming at me affected me badly and it would have been better for me to be bought up by gay people who could finically support me and who didn\u2019t give me severe anxiety from the constant fighting. \n\nShe\u2019s now not talking to me. Calling me disrespectful, saying she gave up a lot for me and I\u2019m ungrateful. \n\nSo AITA for saying this, or is she the asshole? "
