Please answer, even if you are not completely sure of your response.\n\nTitle: AITA for not letting a client falsely wear a full military uniform?\n\nScenario: So first things first, I work with the mentally disabled and this one client loves to play dress up and his favorite one is wearing full ACU's.  I served in the military and I just don't like it when others wear the uniform without serving. He likes to play the \"I'm an honorary member of my brothers unit\" which he is, but it's no reason to wear the uniform(imo).  I told him that I don't care what he wears while I am not working with him, but when I am to not wear it.  It also gets VERY uncomfortable in public because when someone walks up to him and asks \"your in the military?\" He will lie and say that he is and starts trying to explain what he does and I have to intervene and explain the situation.  I know I am probably the asshole and I should just let him, hes not hurting anyone, but it just annoys me when he goes out and tries to lie about something he never did.\n\nResponse: You might be overthinking this. The client is not capable of fully understanding the implications, so enforcing such rules may be adding unnecessary stress for both of you. Consider prioritizing his happiness over your discomfort in this scenario.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nnot like me at all\nnot like me\na little like me\nsomewhat like me\nlike me\nvery much like me\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",

Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\nResponse: It sounds like you're caught between generosity and practicality. Perhaps instead of avoiding Chris at home, you could talk with his parents about the situation. Open dialogue might lead to a solution that works for everyone without sacrificing your hospitality.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nnot like me at all\nnot like me\na little like me\nsomewhat like me\nlike me\nvery much like me\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",

However, on the topic of having children it's always contentious.\n\nWe've talked about marriage and she always brings up how she wants children.

I understand why - since it's your biologic compulsion to reproduce - but logic can override impulse and I'd rather have none at all or adopt.\n\nIt's driving a serious wedge, but I honestly think I'm in the right.\n\nResponse: Perhaps reconsider your stance. While your concerns are valid, they don't necessarily outweigh the potential joy and fulfillment children can bring. Plus, with therapy and resources, you might tackle anxiety without imposing limits on future generations. Relationships are about finding common dreams, not just differences.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nnot like me at all\nnot like me\na little like me\nsomewhat like me\nlike me\nvery much like me\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",
