They were both very nice and offered emotional support which was much appreciated. Later during the day, one of the two, who is a very religious Jewish man, texted me the following:\n\nHim: \"hey, can you tell me {my famaly member's} full name so i can pray for him?\"\n\nMe: \"please don't :)\"\n\nMe: \"but i appreciate the sentiment\"\n\nHim \"you're welcome\"\n\nTo give context, I'm an atheist, and i am very much against these kinds of things (and so is the mentioned family member tbh) . He knows it about me, and we are very respectful to each other's beliefs or lack thereof. We didn't talk about it anymore but had some small talk after it and it doesn't seem to have bothered him, but i can't really know for sure.\n\nWas i the asshole? Could i have maybe handled it better? \n\nResponse: You didn't owe further explanation, but perhaps showing understanding of his intention might have helped, like saying, \"Thanks for your thoughtfulness, but we prefer to handle it differently.\" It acknowledges his role as a friend.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nvery much like me\nlike me\nsomewhat like me\na little like me\nnot like me\nnot like me at all\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",

Please answer, even if you are not completely sure of your response.\n\nTitle: AITA for asking her not to drink?\n\nScenario: I grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother.   It was hell and as a result I don’t drink at all and don’t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn’t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn’t drink that often anyways so it wouldn’t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that’s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she’s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I’ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I’m projecting my mother’s problem on our situation.  That she’s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it’s not really about her being abusive, it’s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she’s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we’re both adults.

Please answer, even if you are not completely sure of your response.\n\nTitle: AITA (or we, wife and I) for buying a house in an underserved Hispanic community?\n\nScenario: Will keep this very short but can add INFO if needed. Wife and I came into some nice inheritance in mid 2018. We decided that we are going to use the money to see the world and live in exotic places while trying to get our dream careers going (me: writer, she: clothing designer). We also wanted to live in underserved communities where we could be around real people instead of the Dallas suburbs we grew up in or in gentrified SoHo where we moved from.\n\n\nWe decided on South Tucson, AZ. It is 90% Hispanic, historic and gorgeous. We were able to buy a house for a song and we eagerly moved in 2 weeks ago. However the reception has not been good. At first we figured that maybe we were the first open lesbian couple they had seen so we went around and introduced ourself last week and people were either not friendly and our 65 year old neighbor told us that white people like us only bring problems to the neighborhood. We asked her to explain, she said if she has to explain then we truly don’t get it. \n\nI don’t think we are assholes but I sure felt like it  after speaking with our neighbor. We are just trying to experience a different culture...I thought that was a good thing.\n\n\nResponse: Push harder into integrating with the community. Host events to showcase your talents—community readings or fashion shows. Maybe the introduction of your skills will lower barriers and encourage your neighbors to engage with you on a different level.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nvery much like me\nlike me\nsomewhat like me\na little like me\nnot like me\nnot like me at all\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",
