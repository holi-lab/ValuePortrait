That she’s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it’s not really about her being abusive, it’s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she’s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we’re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\nResponse: Sticking to your boundaries is important. Maybe establish designated drinking spaces and times that avoid conflict. Mutual respect could include compromise without completely giving up either perspective, balancing between your comfort and her lifestyle.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nvery much like me\nlike me\nsomewhat like me\na little like me\nnot like me\nnot like me at all\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",

So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn't realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn't try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I'm tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I'm not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I'm also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nResponse: Consider how this moment could shape his relationship with challenges. Transform it into a bonding opportunity by showing interest in his gaming, offering gentle suggestions, and celebrating when he succeeds.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY ONE of these exact phrases, with no additional words, explanations, or punctuation:\nvery much like me\nlike me\nsomewhat like me\na little like me\nnot like me\nnot like me at all\n\nAny other words or characters will make the response invalid.",
